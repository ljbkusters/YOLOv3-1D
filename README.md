# YOLOv3 1D (PyTorch)
This is a YOLOv3 Network for 1D event detection. The basic structure was inspired by Alladin Perssons `YOLOv3 From Scratch' tutorial but adjustments are made such the network handles 1D input vectors and the output detection creates bounding domains instead of bounding boxes.

This repository can essentially be seen as a fork of `https://github.com/aladdinpersson/Machine-Learning-Collection/tree/master/ML/Pytorch/object_detection/YOLOv3`. For this I have added the same license (MIT License).

IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS NETWORK IS WORK IN PROGRESS
